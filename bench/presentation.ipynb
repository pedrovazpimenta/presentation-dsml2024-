      "1. **Subquery Approach**: Using `(decade, quantity) IN` is a good approach for maximum quantity determination, but it can often lead to issues if there are ties (i.e., more than one name with the same quantity). A better approach can be achieved using `JOIN` with subqueries or `ROW_NUMBER` techniques if available.\n",
      "  \n",
      "2. **Efficiency**: The use of multiple subqueries and joins might be improved with a cleaner single step, especially if the database system supports Common Table Expressions (CTE) or other window functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clarity and Maintenance**: Complex queries should be as clear as possible, highlighting how they logically construct the desired output. Using aliases more consistently and methodically can sometimes help.\n",

      "### Explanation:\n",
      "- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** are used (`FemaleMax` and `MaleMax`) to first calculate the most popular names for females and males, respectively, along with ranking using `ROW_NUMBER()`, partitioned by `decade` and sorted by `quantity` in descending order.\n",
      "- **Tie Handling**: If there are ties in the number of occurrences (quantity), this solution elects the alphabetically first name by adding `ORDER BY quantity DESC, name` in `ROW_NUMBER()`.\n",
      "- **Efficiency**: The code structure with CTEs also promotes better readability and maintenance.\n",

    "While the Dakota were being expelled, Franklin Steele laid claim to the east bank of Saint Anthony Falls,[82] and John H. Stevens built a home on the west bank.[83] In the Dakota language, the city's name is Bde Óta Othúŋwe ('Many Lakes Town').[g] Residents had divergent ideas on names for their community. Charles Hoag proposed combining the Dakota word for 'water' (mni [h]) with the Greek word for 'city' (polis), yielding Minneapolis. In 1851, after a meeting of the Minnesota Territorial Legislature, leaders of east bank St. Anthony lost their bid to move the capital from Saint Paul, but they eventually won the state university.[90] In 1856, the territorial legislature authorized Minneapolis as a town on the Mississippi's west bank.[86] Minneapolis was incorporated as a city in 1867, and in 1872, it merged with St. Anthony.[91]\n",

    "Minneapolis originated around a source of energy: Saint Anthony Falls, the only natural waterfall on the Mississippi.[16] Each of the city's two founding industries—flour and lumber milling—developed in the 19th century nearly concurrently, and each came to prominence for about fifty years.[j] In 1884, the value of Minneapolis flour milling was the world's highest.[96] In 1899, Minneapolis outsold every other lumber market in the world.[97] Through its expanding mill industries, Minneapolis earned the nickname \"Mill City\".[98] Due to the occupational hazards of milling, six companies manufactured artificial limbs.[99]\n",

    "Disasters struck in the late 19th century: the Eastman tunnel under the river leaked in 1869; twice, fire destroyed the entire row of sawmills on the east bank;[100] an explosion of flour dust at the Washburn A mill killed eighteen people[101] and demolished about half the city's milling capacity;[102] and in 1893, fire spread from Nicollet Island to Boom Island to northeast Minneapolis, destroyed twenty blocks, and killed two people.[103]\n",

    "The lumber industry was built around forests in northern Minnesota, largely by lumbermen emigrating from Maine's depleting forests.[104][105] The region's waterways were used to transport logs well after railroads developed; the Mississippi River carried logs to St. Louis until the early 20th century.[106] In 1871, of the thirteen mills sawing lumber in St. Anthony, eight ran on water power, and five ran on steam power.[107] Auxiliary businesses on the river's west bank included woolen mills, iron works, a railroad machine shop, and mills for cotton, paper, sashes, and wood-planing.[108] Minneapolis supplied the materials for farmsteads and settlement of rapidly expanding cities on the prairies that lacked wood.[109] White pine milled in Minneapolis built Miles City, Montana; Bismarck, North Dakota; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Omaha, Nebraska; and Wichita, Kansas.[110] Growing use of steam power freed lumbermen and their sawmills from dependence on the falls.[111] Lumbering's decline began around the turn of the century,[112] and sawmills in the city including the Weyerhauser mill closed by 1919.[113] After depleting Minnesota's white pine,[114] some lumbermen moved on to Douglas fir in the Pacific Northwest.[115]\n",

    "In 1877, Cadwallader C. Washburn co-founded Washburn-Crosby,[117] the company that became General Mills.[118][k] Washburn and partner John Crosby[119] sent Austrian civil engineer William de la Barre to Hungary where he acquired innovations through industrial espionage.[120] De la Barre calculated and managed the power at the falls and encouraged steam for auxiliary power.[121] Charles Alfred Pillsbury and the C. A. Pillsbury Company across the river hired Washburn-Crosby employees and began using the new methods.[120] The hard red spring wheat grown in Minnesota became valuable, and Minnesota \"patent\" flour was recognized at the time as the best bread flour in the world.[120] In 1900, fourteen percent of America's grain was milled in Minneapolis[120] and about one third of that was shipped overseas.[122] Overall production peaked at 18.5 million barrels in 1916.[123] Decades of soil exhaustion, stem rust, and changes in freight tariffs combined to quash the city's flour industry.[124] In the 1920s, Washburn-Crosby and Pillsbury developed new milling centers in Buffalo, New York, and Kansas City, Missouri, while maintaining their headquarters in Minneapolis.[125] The falls became a national historic district,[126] and the upper St. Anthony lock and dam is permanently closed.[127]\n",
